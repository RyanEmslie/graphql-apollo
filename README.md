Proof of concept app using publically available SpaceX API data.
The backend was setup using Express / GraphQL Server
with React / Apollo frontend.

**TODO**

_React/Frontend_
Unique id error for key in Launches.jsx due to duplicate value in API
Better organize component file structure
Further investigate better usage of <Fragment> vs <div>
Look for alternative to classname module

_Apollo_
Read more on passing props witin <Query variables={''}>

_Style_
remove in-line styling
adjust breakpoint on navbar
increase color contrast on font colors

_Overall_
work on more standardized, less confusing naming convention

\*\*The basic framework for the project backend was inspired by a Travery Media tutorial.
